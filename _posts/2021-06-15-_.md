# ADMIRER
{: .fw-300 .lh-0 }
#### SUMMARY
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 .lh-0 }
<!-- excerpt-start -->
A python script, which imports module without explicitly setting the search path, can be called by a command. Such command has tag SETENV enabled and can be run as superuser, if by user waldo.<br>
<br>
Waldo uses the same credential for logging into the box and configuring website.<br>
<br>
Despite the MySQL server on the box only listens to local clients, one local client called Adminer uses a web page as interface, and such web page is for some reason available to everyone.<br>

Surface check.<br>
`nmap -sV -sC admirer.htb -oA tcp_t1k -v; searchsploit --nmap tcp_t1k.xml -v`<br>
<details close markdown="block">
<summary>
Edit searchsploit to make option nmap somewhat usable. Hope for minor typo fix but end up everywhere. Manual search from now on.
</summary>
Check out how xml is parsed in function `nmapxml()`.<br>
```bash
xmllint --xpath '//address/@addr|//service/@name|//service/@product|//service/@version' "${FILE}" \
    | sed -e $'s/addr=/\\\n[IP] /g;   s/name=/\\\n[NAME] /g;   s/product=/\\\n[PRODUCT] /g;s/" version="/\\\n[VERSION] /g;   s/"//g' \
```
`addr`, `name`, `product`, `version` are all xml attributes that need to be picked up by `sed` expression string, yet only `s/" version="/\\\n[VERSION] /g;` has this weird quoted space situation going on. Space removed.<br>
```
[i] searchsploit openssh 7 4p1 debian 10 deb9u7
```
It's not `openssh 7.4p1 debian 10+deb9u7`?<br>
Check out function `searchsploitout()`, which is where those formatted version strings go.<br>
```bash
## Try and remove terms that could confuse searches
software=$( echo "${software}" | sed -e 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/ /g' )
```
Non-alphanumeric characters are swapped with spaces, to not "confuse searches". Manual search term `openssh 7.4p1`, the search does not seems to be confused tho.<br>

[-] Skipping output: openssh 7.4p1   (Too many results, 100+. You'll need to force a search: searchsploit openssh 7.4p1
```
8, as in the block before, has turned into "Too many results, 100+".<br>
Locate such string, and read code above.<br>
```bash
arg="-t"   ## Title search by default!
```
Manual search term `openssh 7.4p1` but this time with `-t`.<br>
```bash
searchsploit -t 'openssh 7.4p1' | wc -l
226
```
Maybe it is the non-alphanumeric character dot that "confuse searches".<br>
```bash
searchsploit -t 'openssh 7 4p1' | wc -l
472
```
Void, void that arg!<br>
Then the auto-search finally behaves like a manual one: `openssh 7.4p1` is tried, then `openssh 7.4p1 debian` and `openssh 7.4p1 debian 10+deb9u7` and.<br>

Cred should be right, as otherwise the message will be "Permission denied, please try again.", but the connection is closed right after above message being sent.<br>
Send command via ssh does not stop the connection from closing, does not even stall it a bit.<br>
Check out manual of this `vsFTPd 3.0.3`. This `ftpuser` seems to be a "virtual user": "does not exist in `/etc/shadow` file" i.e. it's only for this ftp system. Still no idea why the above message is sent but.

[It's intended that after some digging, the comment in `utility-scripts/db_admin.php`, which is "TODO: Finish implementing this or find a better open source alternative", would remind you field people of a popular application Adminer, so you'd try `adminer.php` under this `utility-scripts/` and voila. Me without experiences just cry for help a lot then voila. Anyways.]<br>

Checking out the database of the blog, using cred in `index.php` file from the ftp share, to be honest, is not even attractive here, as the blog only contains pictures and texts, shown in `dump.sql` from the ftp share. [Can it be that after the database is dumped, it's used for other purposes, which will lead us into the box? Ehh.]<br>
`searchsploit adminer 4.6.2`: no results.<br>
[Hit wall, and don't want to go mix-up-creds-and-try-each-combo-every-frigging-where route. Sure sense googling with version number would provide a quick way out but. Decide to first reason a bit about it myself. As I really don't know shits, and database applications they only aim for storing stuff (and give them back, always give them back), which should be the simplest application to understand.]<br>
<br>
<br>
Start of skiddie wild guess. [You have been warned, and corrections welcome.]<br>
Database applications store and give back stuff, that is, write and then read file in the file system, basically a fancy `vi` and a fancy `cat`. They also provide a way to search through, that is, give back only part of the stuff that has been stored, basically add a fancy `awk` and a fancy `grep`. Maybe that's the selling point of a database over a lame flat file: whatever required will be found out and returned, based on how customers would like to ask for stuff a query language is invented, and then this process of selecting what's asked is optimized towards speed, maybe stuff that's asked for  together a lot simply get fancy `vi`ed together, maybe fancy `grep` would go hoppity hop across lines following some rule instead of going through them one after another.<br>
A database is just a fancy file. Well maybe a fancy file is achieved by one lame file, or many lame files, or maybe fancy files and lame files match in some weird ass way that is good for speed. Still, databases are just fancy files, and a database application simply do fancy `vi` `cat` `awk` `grep` on lame files to give you this delusion of fancy files out of nowhere.<br>
Sanity check. Does the above wild guess match the user experience that I have had?<br>
I start with typing in terminal, say, `mysql -u` and yeee forgot to guess about authentications.<br>
<br>
<br>
Username and password make sense here, afterall files, even the fancy ones, need access control unless this world does not have secrets, well it very much has secrets so. To achieve the decision of who can access a fancy file, well a concept of who need to exist in the first place like duhh, and a username and a password is in this case what makes a who. Just like a lame file system, file permission stuff.<br>
So basically a database application is a fancy file system where you can log in and read write some fancy files! If I recall correctly, it even has its own cute root: king of this limited land and nothing across the border, which is kinda lame, afterall brilliant root, the one of the underlying blunt flat lame yet full-scale file system, can access everything, and the almighty database application from the cute root's point of view, is merely a normal user called `mysql` in the underlying world.<br>
<br>
<br>
At this point it becomes clear that, not having fancy cred only stops us from interacting with fancy file system and as I said earlier, they are ultimately just pictures and texts from the blog and we don't care about them anyways; not having fancy cred does *not* stop us from interacting with the underlying non-fancy file system, it is up to some other rules to stop us and they might just not.<br>
<br>
<br>
The returned stuff from the underlying file system, if any, has to be sent somewhere. It can't stay at any databases on target, as cred with write access there is needed but we don't have any, not to mention we have to read the same database later to get the info. Might as well set up our own database server, create a database x, and a cred saying "allowed to write database x here", and give this cred to database client `Adminer` so it can pass it to the database server on target. Once the server on target come with cred and successfully identified itself to the server on our box as someone who is "allowed to write database x here", we can then issue `LOAD DATA LOCAL` command to it, via `Adminer` of course as we simply lack of other interfaces, and that's it, data will be sent to database x, waiting to be read.<br>
To catch the returned stuff, our database server has to listen on traffic beyond those from localhost, which per my understanding, subject ourselves to the same attack that we're attempting on target. Pretty ironic. To avoid so, use a [pseudo server](https://github.com/allyshka/Rogue-MySql-Server).<br>

I used to assume all environment variables are automatically swapped by sudo, say `/home/bro` to `/home/another_bro`, now that I see `SETENV` appears at the place where `NOPASSWD` used to be, it seems that me the person who type the password, can also type in command line some syntax to set environment variables.<br>

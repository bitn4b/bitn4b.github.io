# MIRAI
{: .fw-300 .lh-0 }
#### SUMMARY
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 .lh-0 }
<!-- excerpt-start -->
Content of a sensitive file is still on disk i.e. not overwritten, despite the file itself got deleted. Such content is viewable by user root. User pi can run all commands as root.<br>
<br>
Pi as part of a default Raspbian install, does not have its password changed. Such password is the only auth required to ssh in as pi, and ssh is available to everyone.<br>

Per nmap, ssh is open on port 22, domain service is open on port 53, and http is open on port 80 with "http-title: Website Blocked". `searchsploit`: nothing interesting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe the virtual host if any is not `mirai.htb` and this causes blocking. Scan again but with ip supplied. `nmap -sV -sC -p80 10.10.10.48`, still "http-title: Website Blocked". Decide to manual check.<br>
<a id="foothold"></a>
`curl 10.10.10.48 -v` response contains header "X-Pi-hole: A black hole for Internet advertisements". [Thought it was a firewall with troll built in for a moment but.] Need to unhole our target.<br>
<br>
<br>
Visit Pi-hole website, right on the frontpage: "Our Web interface offers control of your Pi-hole and a central place to view statistics". Actually prefer "Our Web interface offers statistics of your Pi-hole and a central place to control it". Could waste time trying to log into this web thing, if unblock functionality is not even part of it.<br>
Fail to locate relevant info in documentation. Decide to dig in [discourse](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/). Go through postings and unexpected enough: different discourse accounts but in their screenshots, web interface all have the same url, `pi.hole`. A public DNS server couldn't possibly know out of all the Pi-hole instances which one to point to right. Resolving such domain sure can rely on users manually config their local DNS cache, but for an application proudly claim offering "network-wide" protection? Ehh. Also, wouldn't it be weird if such domain is up to users to set up and multiple cute home users in a roll all come up with this boring ass name `pi.hole`?<br>
Chances are this Pi-hole thing comes with its own DNS server and users only need to adjust some router settings to achieve "network-wide" typing in the given `pi.hole` and getting the web console page experience. Anyways, if a DNS server has record for `pi.hole`, this DNS server almost certainly belongs to a Pi-hole itself.<br>
Recall that per nmap, there is one domain service open on port 53, might as well test it. If it leads to the Pi-hole, need to search for exploits despite `searchsploit` says nothing, maybe then we get to unblock target somehow; if not, can only download Pi-hole and check out web interface that way, should be faster now that no luck at discourse.<br>

[I know nothing about network if you haven't noticed, but why the ip is not `10.10.10.48`?]<br>

[I know nothing about network if you haven't noticed, but why the name is not `pi.hole`?]<br>
The returned host name of that Pi-hole thing is `raspberrypi`. According to Pi-hole documentation: "Despite the name, you are not limited to running Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi. Any hardware that runs one of the supported operating systems will do". But now it seems to really be a Raspbian, yeee.<br>
No idea if the ssh open on port 22 belongs to this Raspbian as well, but decide to test ssh in with default cred `pi:raspberry` real quick before searching exploits for the domain service.<br>

SSH is enabled and the default password for the 'pi' user has not been changed.
This is a security risk - please login as the 'pi' user and type 'passwd' to set a new password.

According to [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/4z03ow/whitelist_prepopulated_on_install/), a default whitelist contains all the above entries.<br>

User pi may run the following commands on localhost:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
`sudo cat /root/root.txt`<br>

I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...
```
<br>
<br>
`df | grep sd` contains mount point `/media/usbstick`.<br>
`cd /media/usbstick; ls`<br>
```
damnit.txt  lost+found
```
`lost+found` empty, content of `damnit.txt` pretty much foreseeable.<br>
```
Damnit! Sorry man I accidentally deleted your files off the USB stick.
Do you know if there is any way to get them back?

# CHAINSAW
{: .fw-300 .lh-0 }
#### SUMMARY
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 .lh-0 }
<!-- excerpt-start -->
A superuser-owned and SUID-bit-set binary does not specify full path. Such binary resides at a directory owned by user bobby and can be executed by user bobby.<br>
<br>
User bobby's ssh private key is distributed via email by user administrator, and for some reason the email content is stored on the box, in a file viewable by user administrator.<br>
<br>
User administrator runs an application which takes input without sanitization from an Ethereum smart contract. Such smart contract seems not signed upon creation, and contains a function that can set the input value, and the visibility of this function is public. The RPC endpoint of this Ethereum network is available for everyone.<br>

Per nmap, ftp is open on port 21 and ssh is open on port 22. `vsftpd 3.0.3` config option `anonymous_enable` and `no_anon_password` are set, thus a login with username `ftp` or `anonymous` and no password, is allowed. Nmap logs in via such mean and lists three files: `WeaponizedPing.json`, `WeaponizedPing.sol`, and `address.txt`. The last-modified time of `address.txt` is suspiciously close to now, no idea why.<br>
`searchsploit`: nothing interesting.<br>
<a id="foothold"></a>
`wget ftp://ftp:@chainsaw.htb/*` to download the share for a view.<br>
<br>
<br>
Upon saving files, `wget` prints that `WeaponizedPing.json` is 23828 characters long, while `WeaponizedPing.sol` being 243, that is, almost 100 times of size difference. Decide to check out the smaller one first, as they share the non-extension part of their filenames, should be related somehow.<br>
Content of `WeaponizedPing.sol`.<br>
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract WeaponizedPing {
  string store = "google.com";

  function getDomain() public view returns (string) {
      return store;
  }

  function setDomain(string _value) public {
      store = _value;
  }
}
```
A variable (`store`) whose current value appears to be a domain name (`google.com`), and two functions, one (`getDomain`) to call for getting the current value of such variable, and one (`setDomain`) to call for setting a new value for such variable. This bundle of stuff is named `WeaponizedPing`, a domain name sure can be the argument supplied to a ping application. but no idea how such application looks like to a point where it can claim to be "weaponized".<br>
<br>
<br>
According to [this documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.4.24/index.html), the `solidity ^0.4.24` written in the first line signifies that, the bundle of stuff below that we just talked about, also called a contract, is written in a language called `solidity`, and is intended to be compiled by Solidity Compiler with version from `0.4.24` up to but not include `0.5.0`. Also upon compilation, "a JSON file, the contract metadata, that contains information about the current contract" will be automatically generated.<br>
Examine `WeaponizedPing.json` under [a JSON formatter](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com) confirms that `sourcePath` is the original full path of `WeaponizedPing.sol`, and `source` is the content of `WeaponizedPing.sol` (one variable and two functions which simply get and set the value of this one variable, as we saw earlier) written as one string. The `compiler` indeed is `solc 0.4.24`.<br>
The rest is mainly compiled `bytecode`, info of which part of the `bytecode` is translated from which part of the source, a huge amount of metadata of the source, namely `abi`, `ast`, `legacyAST`, which account for the almost 100x size difference, and some trivia such as version number of the overall formatting and the last-updated date of this JSON.<br>
The value of key `address`, which is nested under key `networks`, initially pops out as interesting, for it looks like the same type of thing found in that `address.txt` file in the ftp share. But later on the documentation points out that it is the hash and thus used as the identifier of the current contract, in this case, string `google.com` and its interface. Can it be that the address in that shared `address.txt`, when queried, points to a string that is not `google.com`, that is, some secret virtual host of the box, which lead us to some new file share? Or maybe even points to an unrelated contract? Ehh.<br>

![](/assets/images/chainsaw/json_addr.png)
[`address`, 40-digit hex, just like the one in `address.txt`.]<br>
</details>
<br>
<br>
At this point, the initial surface check is done. It appears that of all the three files shared via ftp:<br>
`WeaponizedPing.sol` simply says this string `google.com` exists, and function `setDomain` can be called to create a new value and bind variable name `store` to it;<br>
`WeaponizedPing.json` is reiterating the content of `WeaponizedPing.sol` in some super verbose way, the only new stuff is an address, but we already know it points to string `google.com` and I really can't see how this address can be used besides to query what value resides at it. Maybe to set a new value, which resides at a new address, the old address need to be supplied as well, so the order of what changing to what can be documented? But even so, the info in this JSON file is last updated at Dec 2018 according to the metadata, unless no new values are set during these years, I can't see how this `WeaponizedPing.json` is necessary for anything;<br>
The address in `address.txt` may point to the newer value of variable `store`, which would render the address in `WeaponizedPing.json` useless. This newer value itself might not be intereting, as we've guessed earlier, but still its address may be useful to call set on it.<br>
<br>
<br>
So to sum up, the whole ftp share really just boils down to the syntax `setDomain` for sure, and maybe the address in `address.txt`. [And maybe I feel sorry taking you everywhere but only comes to this conclusion.]<br>
<br>
<br>
And that's it. How the genuineness of a piece of record is handled, essentially what defines a blockchain, doesn't quite come into play here. Per my best understanding, such work is done via Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the thing that all thoses compiled bytecodes are for, yet the only surface provided here is language Solidity, which simply *uses* records, just like every non-blockchain-related language does. So in this case, we can just ignore that this is an Ethereum application instead of a normal one, as such low-level attack surface simply is not exposed to us. Rest assured that all we need to do is normal boring sending strings (syntax `setDomain`, new value string, and maybe the address in `address.txt`) in some format to somewhere, phew, and see how the application behaves, aiming for code execution.<br>
No idea in what format and to where should those strings be sent tho. Plan to `nmap` again but what protocols to even scan for.<br>
<br>
<br>
Refer to [the Solidity 0.4.24 documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.4.24/index.html) again, "The best way to try out Solidity right now is using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)". [The fact that this Remix is a website already says something about the communication protocol, but I for some reason think browsers support a bajillion protocols so I keep searching for network-related information on this website.]<br>

[Not interested in deploy contracts on our own box, we don't even have the network setup, so skip the "Compile" tab, land in "Run" tab. The "Account" thing is new, what's more interesting is that it is also 40-digit hex, just like addresses, could be some hashed encryption key i.e. resolves to an encryption key, hope the key that signed target is zero? Do I have to pay gas? Whoa I sound like an asshole. There is a place for address, but says to load contract, so we don't even need the `WeaponizedPing.sol` file, we can just find the endpoint and query it the address in `address.txt`. Maybe we don't even need that address, we can just find the endpoint and query it what's on chain. Huh, now I feel even more sorry taking you everywhere.]<br>

[Not interested in scripting JavaScript in brower console, so skip the "JavaScript VM" option of "Environment", land in "Web3" stuff, seems to be http or https.]<br>

[Yup. Now we get to type url in the box and button clicking from now on instead of JavaScripting, per my understanding.]<br>

[Side note again, one example confirms that I need to be sorry.]<br>

[Another example confirms that address "from" is needed.]<br>
</details>
`nmap -p- chainsaw.htb -oA tcp_all -v` returns port `9810`, `-sV -sC` on this port won't help much as the `Content-Type` need to be `application/json` in the first place.<br>
Time to decide payload to this `WeaponizedPing`, blackbox with "weaponized" in its name ye just gotta love it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Decide to keep the `google.com` string and add some `-c 1` so nobody~~, not even Google,~~ gets flooded. The payload ends up being `google.com -c 1; <rev_shell>; ping -c 1 google.com`.<br>
[If `setDomain` looped...maybe this is a fake network. Also my reverse shell code is on chain now, not that it matters but.]<br>
Fill in endpoint url as "Web3 Provider", "Load contract from Address" with the address in `address.txt`, supply payload and hit that `setDomain` button.<br>
<br>

And we are user `administrator` now, and without user flag. [And I'm tired.]<br>
List directory home reveals `bobby`, we have to be user `bobby`, check out how user `administrator` relates to user `bobby`.<br>
`grep -r -i bobby /home/administrator`<br>
```

```
So Bobby is a "Smart Contract Auditor", which could be the reason why he is on the box with administrator, also there is one email to Bobby and "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=bobby.key.enc" seems interesting. Such data is stored in block "CIQG3...NTOYQ" in `ipfs`, `fs` could mean file system, fancy files here. The fact that `grep` can successfully filter out content suggests `ipfs` command-line interface is not needed to dump the content of the block, afterall what's shown here above is UNIX file system directory.<br>
`cat /home/administrator/.ipfs/blocks/OY/CIQG3...NTOYQ.data`<br>

The text part of the email states that ssh password auth is disabled, the attachment is encrypted ssh private key and one should physically show up at reception desk to claim the encryption password. Weird priority.<br>
The encryption password is in `rockyou.txt`: `jackychain`.<br>
We are user `bobby` now.<br>

<a id="root"></a>
As a "Smart Contract Auditor", Bobby has on the box a smart contract project called "ChainsawClub", the layout of the project directory looks similar to that in the ftp share: `ChainsawClub.json`, `ChainsawClub.sol`, but this time we have the application binary `ChainsawClub`, and it for some reason is owned by root and with suid bit set. Reverse engineer it to see what it does with contract data.<br>
`strings /home/bobby/projects/ChainsawClub`<br>
```
sudo -i -u root /root/ChainsawClub/dist/ChainsawClub/ChainsawClub
```
`sudo` without full path and we owns the current path which means we get to decide the future path.<br>

<br>
`cat /root/root.txt`<br>
```
Mine deeper to get rewarded with root coin (RTC)...
```
Root flag is defined as that hash thing under the name `/root/root.txt` isn't it. Some searching points to command `debugfs`, according to its helping page, `cat` means "dump an inode out to stdout", as seen earlier `cat` doesn't include the hash, so per `debugfs` terminology, we need to "dump" something bigger than an "inode", and "block" seems to be the only candidate here.<br>
